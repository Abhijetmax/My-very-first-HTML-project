  <h1>How to Make Coffee Without a Coffee Maker in these Quarantine Days:</h1> <!-- A few introductions and stuffs-->
  <p> Hello folks, what's up? I'm <strong>Abhijet</strong> here with you, wanna discuss about a common thing which you'll face now-a-days if you're a coffee lover and used to drink coffee from Coffee-Shops. Due to <strong>COVID-19</strong>, we, the coffee lovers have to stay at house and guess what? Don't you miss your regular Coffee(s)?</p>
  <p>well, if you're a bachelor and have to stay away from home, then surely you miss your <strong>'Coffee Days'</strong>, don't you?</p>
  Now, let's come to the point. I know, you miss your coffee if you used to drink coffee from shops and don't know properly how to make coffee at your house without a <em>coffee maker</em>.

  <p>I know you do miss your coffee because so did I and I didn't know how to make coffee either a couple of days ago. Then I googled it and found a great recipe. So, I thought why don't I share that with other peoples like me! And so, here I go.....</p>

  <h3>What You Need:</h3> <!-- Now the ingredients-->
  <ul>
    <li>Ground coffee beans (medium/fine), about two tablespoons for every 6 ounces of water (2)</li>
    <li>Stove/heat source to boil water</li>
    <li>Pan or pot (it's easier with a small saucepan)</li>
    <li>Coffee mug or cup</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>How To Do It:</h3> <!-- And now the ways-->
  <ol>
    <li>Fill a clean pan with a bit more water than you normally use when you brew your coffee. For example, if you use two cups of water, add an extra 3/4 cup this time. With this saucepan method, some water will be left in the pan, along with the grounds/sludge.</li>
    <li>Place the pan on your stove and turn on the heat. When the water comes to a boil, add your coffee. A rough amount of coffee is about two tablespoons for every 6 ounces of water, but you can change that depending on how strong you want your coffee.</li>
    <li>Remove the pan from heat and cover immediately. Wait four to five minutes before you uncover the pan. Once you see that all grounds have settled to the bottom of the pan, you're ready to serve your coffee.
        If the grounds haven't settled, try sprinkling a little cold water on them to help them sink.</li>
    <li>No fancy kettles needed here, you can just pour the coffee off the top onto your cup. You can also opt to use a ladle for more filtered servings.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>So, that's it. Follow those simple steps & look, your coffee is ready! <strong><em>ENJOY!!!</em></strong></h3> <!-- And now, Happy Ending! Thanks for reading this all.-->
